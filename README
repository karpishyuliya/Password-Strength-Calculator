==== Password Strength Calculator ====
======================================

Creator: sp0rus (John Stitt)
Language: Java
Purpose: A very basic password strength calculator I created for fun one day.
         Every now and then more functionality is added, or old code is improved.
Usage:
        Compile: javac pwstrength.java
        Run with arguments: java pwstrength [PASSWORD]
        Run w/o arguments: java pwstrength

Not the most useful thing in the world, but it's something.
